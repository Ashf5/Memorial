            <h1>About This Site</h1>
            <p>This website was created in memory of the brave soldiers who fell during the Iron Swords War. Many of them were young, full of life, and never had the chance to build the families or futures they dreamed of. Their sacrifice is etched into our history, and it is our duty to honor themâ€”not only with remembrance, but with meaningful actions that keep their spirit alive.</p>
            <p>Here, you can select the name of a fallen soldier and dedicate a good deed in their memory. Whether it is an act of kindness, charity, or service, every deed performed for their soul carries forward the light they left behind. Together, we ensure that while their lives were cut short, their legacy continues to inspire goodness in the world.</p>
